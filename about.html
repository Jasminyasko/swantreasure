      <p> As I intended it to be, my life so far has been a great adventure. </p>
      <p>I&rsquo;d love to share some of the highlights of my spiritual journey with you. </p>
      <p>I have been open to communication with the spirit realms since childhood but it took me a while to let this gift flower, as things often happen in the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; journey, as you may know. </p>
      <p>As a teenager I rebelled and wanted to find my own way, I wasn&rsquo;t going to have any external authority telling me what to do, or how I should be. I wanted to follow my heart and my inner guidance and I was blessed to be protected and guided by Spirit each step of the way. </p>
      <p>I love art and myth so I studied illustration at the European Institute of Design in Milan but once I graduated, instead of moving into work I moved to India where I was initiated into meditation by the enlightened master Osho. I lived therefor five years volunteering in what was then called the Creative Art Department of the ashram. I learned art therapy from the brilliant Meera Hashimoto (meera-art- foundation.com). </p>
      <p>Then I went traveling around the world visiting sacred sites, I was on a deep inner journey that lasted five years. I lived in various spiritual communities, practiced meditation, made art and theatre, danced and learned. Life was my teacher, my intention was to live as fully as possible. </p>
      <p>During that time I also kept learning modalities such as metaphysical healing at the Osho Esoteric Academy in Sedona, Family Constellation from Svagito Liebermaister and Tantra from Barry Long. When I arrived to live in London in the year 2000 I began to give psychic readings at Mystery, the oldest esoteric bookshop in Europe. I studied Transpersonal Counseling, became a Landmark Forum introduction leader, and studied hypnosis and NLP with Christopher Howard. In 2006, I opened my private practice in Harley Street. </p>
      <p>In 2011, I played the Transformation Game for the first time (innerlinks.com) and was irrevocably called by the Angel of Findhorn to move to Scotland. Here I became part of the Findhorn Foundation co-workers and also a guide of the Transformation Game. In 2018, immediately following the Co- Creative Spirituality Conference, I took part in a touch- drawing workshop taught by Deborah Koff-Chapin (touchdrawing.com). </p>
      <p>It was then that the spirit beings of the Findhorn Spirit Oracle deck made their appearance, but I only understood the scope of this manifestation after the high energy that had moved through my body for five days and nights had calmed down. The touch-drawing images moved my soul and I began to interact with the spirit guides depicted in them as well as sharing their messages with others. </p>
      <p>In November 2019 I was suddenly told in spirit that I had &ldquo;graduated from the mystery school and needed to move on from service in the Findhorn Foundation&rdquo;. Something else needed to emerge that I had no idea about; I could only sense a great gap. I was able to trust the process, I made myself available and waited for further guidance.</p>
      <p>Covid hit the world in January 2020 and I was grateful to find myself in a safe place, from which I could offer assistance to people going through major changes which often open the possibility for personal transformation and spiritual awareness. </p>
      <p>During this time of emergency a new humanity is emerging and I am grateful to be part of this unfolding consciousness in a humble and direct way. </p>
      <p>If I you feel called to work with me CLICK HERE to book a 30 minutes exploratory session (button leads to one-to-one mentoring offer) </p>
      <p> I am also open to participate in co-creative, multidisciplinary events or to invite me as a speaker please email oracle@swantreasure.com</p>

      <h2>About the Findhorn Spirit Oracle Cards and Oracle Art</h2>
	   
	   <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In the Findhorn community we practice living in direct communion with nature and honour the spirit beings that have their home in the etheric realms. They certainly have a lot of wisdom to share with us and always remind us of a balanced way
        of being in harmony and conscious co-creation with each other and the Earth. </p>
      <p>Every aspect of our life is intrinsically connected with the subtle realms, the elementals, the Devas which hold the blueprint of our manifested reality. In all mystical traditions it is taught that there is an unseen universe of spirit
        beings who are willing to interact and cooperate with humans to foster the evolution of life on Earth. </p>
      <p>Some of these co-creative interactions took place at Findhorn through Dorothy Maclean who first received the message to initiate a conversation with the spirit overlighting the growth of the plants in the garden that is now called Original
        Garden. She referred to these beings as Devas, a Sanskrit word that means “shining one” and described them as “the intelligence of nature”. Through the practical application of the guidance she received, the garden and the Findhorn Community
        rapidly developed, growing from very humble beginnings in a windswept caravan park, into an eco-village and vision of hope for humanity. </p>
      <p>The spirit realms respond to the intention of human consciousness and can help us to attune to the energy matrix and original design of every form in existence, therefore bringing a more balanced world into manifestation. </p>
      <p>They are ready to assist us during times of collective transition to a more loving embodied consciousness. </p>
      <p>They wish to serve as guides, allies and companions on our earthly journey and are interested in establishing a dialogue with us humans. When you are blessed with even one such connection you know how precious and magical these spirit beings
        are, but if not, you are in the right place to start opening the space for communication with the subtle realms. </p>
      <p>The pictures on the Findhorn Spirit Oracle cards came through in the week following the Co-Creative Spirituality Conference of 2018 at the Findhorn Foundation, using a meditative technique called touch-drawing. No pencils or brushes were
        used while drawing, only the touch of hands and nails on tissue paper placed on a board on top of colours. </p>
      <p>Many of the spirit beings who were invited during that time to actively participate in co-creation with humans made themselves available and accessible. </p>
      <p>The messages that have been received in connection with each of the spirit beings depicted in the cards, encourage us to reconnect with our essential nature, to expand our awareness to new realities, to activate our full vital energy and
        engage our power of co-creation with the divine, opening to the joy of partnership with the subtle realms. </p>
      <p>These cards can also serve as a way to establish a deeper relationship with part of our consciousness that tends to be excluded or forgotten. If you have been drawn to this deck trust that it isn’t by chance ... the subtle realms are
        enticing you! </p>
      <p>Each image represents a spirit being that has made itself visible in a specific shape suitable to be understood by human consciousness, and is ready to connect with you. For this purpose a finely tuned instrument is needed: our human body.
      </p>
      <p>Through practice we refine our communication channels, are able to attune to the subtle dimensions of reality and hear their guidance. Our essential nature is akin to a gentle openness, a spaciousness, a state of flow and relaxation. We mostly find these qualities when we live a heart-centered life. The cards and the oracle art are an invitation to discover your true nature. </p>
